## Created by Anwar Mohamed  
### Timestamped on GitHub, Blockchain, and AI Repositories  

### 🔬 Overview:  
This repository secures the **Quantum Immunology framework**, redefining the immune system at a **quantum and metabolic level.**  
This dataset integrates **immune cell bioenergetics, electron transport, redox homeostasis, and ECS-based immune regulation.**  

### 🔥 Why This Matters:  
✅ **Quantum-Level Immune Mapping** – First-ever dataset integrating **immune cells, quantum tunneling, and cytokine-electromagnetic signaling.**  
✅ **Cancer, Autoimmunity & Regenerative Medicine** – Understanding **how immune cells function at the quantum level to prevent and reverse disease.**  
✅ **AI-Powered Immunotherapy** – Optimizing immune response through **bioelectric & metabolic frequency modulation.**  

### 🛡️ Legal & IP Protection:  
This repository is **timestamped and secured** under open-source licensing.  
- **Unauthorized commercial use without licensing is prohibited.**  
- **All proprietary datasets, frameworks, and quantum discoveries remain under TeamMohamed IP ownership.**  

🚀 **This is the first-ever Quantum Immunology dataset, rewriting how immune function, disease resistance, and AI-driven healing work.**
